    "# Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context:\n",
    "You are hired as a database designer to create a comprehensive database system for OCU's campus library. The library needs to efficiently manage information about books, authors, students, faculty, borrowing, and returning of books. The library serves multiple departments (schools) within the university and needs to keep track of various activities such as book availability, overdue fines, and transaction details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem:\n",
    "Create a Library Management System through the creation and design a relational database for the library. Identify entities and their attributes, define tables, normalize these tables, and create the database in MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Identify Entities and Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify the main entities involved in the library system (e.g., books, authors, students, faculty, borrowing, returning).\n",
    "Determine the attributes for each entity (e.g., book ID, title, author name, student ID, name, faculty ID, department, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Define Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a list of tables based on the identified entities and their attributes.\n",
    "Determine the primary keys for each table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Normalize Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalize the tables to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.\n",
    "Identify relationships between different entities and create foreign keys where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Create the Database in MySQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using MySQL syntax, create a new database for the library system.\n",
    "Create tables based on the normalized design, specifying data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.\n",
    "Insert sample data into the tables to demonstrate the relationships between entities (e.g., books, authors, students, faculty, borrowing records).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Write SQL Queries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write SQL queries to retrieve information from the database, such as:\n",
    "List all books available in the library.\n",
    "Find the names of students who have borrowed a specific book.\n",
    "Calculate the total fines collected by the library.\n",
    "List all overdue books.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Create a Python CRUD Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a Python application that allows users to interact with the MySQL database. You can create functions or classes for each CRUD operation for each table in the database. Here's a general outline of what this component might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create (Insert): Write functions to insert new records into the database tables. For example, you can create functions to add new books, authors, students, faculty members, borrowing records, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read (Select): Implement functions to retrieve data from the database. You can create functions to fetch information such as a list of all books, book details, student information, borrowing history, overdue books, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (OPTIONAL) Update: Design functions that allow users to update existing records. For instance, you can create functions to update book information, student records, or borrowing details.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delete: Implement functions to delete records from the database when necessary. This could include removing books, deleting student or faculty records, or clearing borrowing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Integrate Pandas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the Pandas library to make working with data in Python more convenient. For example, you can load query results into Pandas DataFrames, which makes data manipulation and analysis easier. Here's how you can integrate Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* After running SQL SELECT queries to fetch data, convert the result sets into Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (OPTIONAL) Utilize Pandas DataFrame operations for data filtering, sorting, and analysis as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (OPTIONAL) For creating new records (INSERT), you can create Pandas DataFrames with user input and then insert these records into the respective database tables."
