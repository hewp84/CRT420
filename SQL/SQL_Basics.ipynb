    "## 7. Table Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. One-to-One Relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a one-to-one relationship, each record in the first table is associated with only one record in the second table, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-one relationships are used to connect two entities where each instance in the relationship corresponds to exactly one instance in the related table. This type of relationship is uncommon in most database designs and is typically used when specific attributes of an entity need to be separated into a distinct table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Staff\n",
    "* StaffID (Primary Key)\n",
    "* Name\n",
    "* Position\n",
    "\n",
    "IDCard\n",
    "* IDCardID (Primary Key)\n",
    "* StaffID (Foreign Key referencing Staff table)\n",
    "* CardNumber\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, each staff member in the \"Staff\" table has a unique ID represented by \"StaffID\". Their corresponding ID card information, such as \"CardNumber\", is stored in the \"IDCard\" table. The \"StaffID\" in the \"IDCard\" table establishes the one-to-one relationship, ensuring that each staff member has only one ID card.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. One-to-Many Relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a one-to-many relationship, each record in the first table can have multiple related records in the second table, but each record in the second table corresponds to only one record in the first table.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-many relationships are the most common type of relationship in relational databases. In this relationship, one entity (the \"one\" side) can be associated with multiple instances of another entity (the \"many\" side), but each instance of the latter can be linked to only one instance of the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Departments\n",
    "* DepartmentID (Primary Key)\n",
    "* DepartmentName\n",
    "\n",
    "Professors\n",
    "* ProfessorID (Primary Key)\n",
    "* Name\n",
    "* DepartmentID (Foreign Key referencing Departments table)\n",
    "* Subject\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"Departments\" table stores information about different college departments, with each department having a unique \"DepartmentID\". The \"Professors\" table contains details about professors. The \"DepartmentID\" in the \"Professors\" table establishes the one-to-many relationship, indicating that each department can have multiple professors, but each professor belongs to only one department.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Many-to-Many Relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a many-to-many relationship, each record in both tables can have multiple related records in the other table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-many relationships are used to model complex interactions where multiple instances of one entity are related to multiple instances of another entity. To represent this relationship in a relational database, a junction table (also called an associative or link table) is introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Students\n",
    "* StudentID (Primary Key)\n",
    "* Name\n",
    "\n",
    "Courses\n",
    "* CourseID (Primary Key)\n",
    "* CourseName\n",
    "\n",
    "StudentCourses (Junction Table)\n",
    "* StudentCoursesID (Primary Key)\n",
    "* StudentID (Foreign Key referencing Students table)\n",
    "* CourseID (Foreign Key referencing Courses table)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"Students\" table stores student information, the \"Courses\" table stores course details, and the \"StudentCourses\" table acts as a junction table. The \"StudentID\" and \"CourseID\" columns in the \"StudentCourses\" table establish many-to-many relationships. This setup allows multiple students to be enrolled in multiple courses, creating a comprehensive representation of the relationships between students and courses."
